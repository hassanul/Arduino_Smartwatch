# Arduino_Smartwatch
Welcome! Thank you for your interest in my project! This was a personal project in which the smartwatch is able to sync time with the Android based phone and show SMSes.

As I only do coding as a hobby, the code may not be optimised and/or bug-free. Thus do provide feedbacks and share your improvements if any! And if you successfully made this project and/or use it as a base, do share it with others as well!

Thank you!
